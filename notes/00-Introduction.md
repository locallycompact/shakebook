# Hello World

This is an example markdown Gitbook generated by [this template repository](https://gitlab.com/zenhaskell/gitbook-template) and deployed with gitlab pages. To use it simply fork the repository on gitlab and the ci will take care of the rest.

You can use the same markdown to generate a [pdf copy](book.pdf), or [slides](slides.pdf).

# Features

# Testing Locally

You will need haskell and stack, you will also need to install pandoc and shake with:

    stack install pandoc shake

You can then test this in chromium by doing

    stack exec shake test

or change the browser by editing the Shakefile.hs.
